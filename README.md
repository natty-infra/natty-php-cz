# tefek.cz

My 2019-ish personal website. Testing `docker-compose.yaml` included.

## Running

Run using docker-compose or an equivalent alternative:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

This compose-file is obviously not production-ready and by default listens
on the **port 8081**. Change it to your needs.
